 I am currently working as  a postdoctoral fellow under the mentorship of Professor Shi Liu at Westlake University. During my postdoctoral fellowship, I have been engaged in the development of novel high-pressure lithium-ion electrolytes and the analysis of electrolyte structural dynamics. Additionally, I have been working on the polarization flipping dynamics of two-dimensional ferroelectric materials based on machine learning potential. In February 2021, I earned my Ph.D. degree from the  Department of Nanofusion Technology at Pusan National University, Korea, supervised by Professor Joonkyung Jang. My doctoral research was focused on soft condensed matter physics, including liquid dynamics, phase transition behavior, and interfacial properties using various computational methods and simulation techniques. Prior to my time  at Pusan National University, I completed my Bachelor of Science degree in July 2015 at the Department of Polymer Materials and Engineering, Zhongyuan University of Technology, China.
