I am currently a **Postdoc Fellow** in [Prof. Shi Liu's group](https://liutheory.westlake.edu.cn/) at [Department of Physics, Westlake University](https://www.westlake.edu.cn/), Hangzhou, China.

I graduated with my Ph.D from the Department of Nanofusion Technology at [Pusan National University](https://www.pusan.ac.kr/) in 2021, South Korea, under the supervision of [Prof. Joonkyung Jang](https://nanochem.pusan.ac.kr/).
