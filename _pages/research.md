My research interests lie in understanding structures and dynamics of liquid−solid and liquid−air interfaces, liquid water, etc. in soft condensed matter. I use theoretical tools from molecular dynamics simulation techniques and ab initio calculation method as well as deep learning methods. Currently, I am working on the force field development of novel high-voltage lithium-ion electrolytes and the analysis of electrolyte structural dynamics. Additionally, I have been working on the polarization flipping dynamics of two-dimensional ferroelectric materials based on machine learning potential.

## Accurate deep potentia of Li-Ion Concentrated Electrolytes

<!-- The wide electrochemical stability window and nonflammable characteristics exhibited by the localized super-high concentration aqueous electrolyte of lithium-ion batteries have brought new ideas for the development of next-generation power requirements. Ion transport, as one of the most fundamental processes of electrolytes, is important for the design and development of high performance nonflammable batteries. However, atomistic mechanisms and characteristics of ion transport in localized ultra-high concentration electrolytes remain largely unexplored. I employ the "modular development of deep potential" strategy, integrating deep learning, first-principles calculations, and molecular dynamics methods, to develop a deep neural network-based model potential known as Deep Potential(forcefield). The development of this deep potential is of great significance for enabling large-scale molecular dynamics simulations of complex high-concentration electrolytes, as well as opening up avenues for analyzing the microscopic structure, ion conductivity, and transport mechanisms of localized ultra-high concentration electrolytes. -->

 <!-- Two-dimensional (2D) ferroelectric semiconductors with electrically addressable vertical polarization present opportunities for integrating ferroelectrics into high-density ultrathin nanoelectronics, yet quantitative microscopic understanding of ferroelectric switching in 2D is rather limited. We employ deep-learning-assisted large-scale molecular dynamics simulations to analyze the switching processes of 2D domains and 1D domain walls in 2D ferroelectrics with out-of-plane polarization, revealing mechanisms fundamentally different from those of bulk ferroelectrics. We discover that a single domain is unswitchable by an out-of-plane electric field due to forbidden splitting of Wyckoff orbits. This ``splitting restriction principle" is a prevalent feature across a wide spectrum of 2D systems with sliding ferroelectricity and moir\'e ferroelectricity. Despite lacking in-plane effective polarization, 1D domain walls are easily moved by in-plane fields, exhibiting unusual avalanche dynamics characterized by abrupt, intermittent moving patterns. The propagating velocity at various temperatures, field orientations, and strengths can be statistically described with a universal creep equation, featuring a dynamical exponent of 2 that is distinct from all known values for elastic interfaces moving in disordered media. We demonstrate a tunable onset field for the intrinsic creep-depinning transition, suggesting a simple route for on-demand configuration of switching speed. -->
