I am interested in applying theoretical numerical calculation to solve the physical/chemical problems, and focus on using the molecular dynamics simulation techniques, ab initio calculation method together with experimental spectroscopies, such as sum frequency generation spectroscopy (SFG) and X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) to understand the structures and dynamics of liquid−solid and liquid−air interfaces, liquid water, ice and hydrogen-bonded organic materials, etc.

Currently, I am working on the projects of novel high-voltage lithium-ion electrolytes and the analysis of electrolyte structural dynamics. Additionally, I have been working on the polarization flipping dynamics of two-dimensional ferroelectric materials based on machine learning potential.

## Computational Design and Development of Li-Ion Concentrated Electrolytes

Li-ion battery electrolytes with enhanced transport properties may enable batteries with higher energy and power densities. I use molecular dynamics simulations to study how these macroscopic transport quantities arise from molecular-level interactions between ions in solution. Using the theoretical developments described below, I rigorously quantify ion correlations in the electrolyte, which can substantially impact macroscopic transport but are challenging to measure experimentally. The aim of this work is to provide insight into the types of electrolyte formulations which may yield high conductivity, high cation transference number, or facile transport under low temperature conditions. My work thus far has in particular explored the transport properties of nonaqueous polyelectrolyte solutions and polymerized ionic liquids.
