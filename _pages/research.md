I am interested in applying theoretical numerical calculation to solve the physical/chemical problems, and focus on using the molecular dynamics simulation techniques, ab initio calculation method together with experimental spectroscopies, such as sum frequency generation spectroscopy (SFG) and X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) to understand the structures and dynamics of liquid−solid and liquid−air interfaces, liquid water, ice and hydrogen-bonded organic materials, etc.

Currently, I am working on the projects of novel high-voltage lithium-ion electrolytes and the analysis of electrolyte structural dynamics. Additionally, I have been working on the polarization flipping dynamics of two-dimensional ferroelectric materials based on machine learning potential.

I am currently working as  a postdoctoral fellow under the mentorship of Professor Shi Liu at Westlake University. During my postdoctoral fellowship, I have been engaged in the development of novel high-pressure lithium-ion electrolytes and the analysis of electrolyte structural dynamics. Additionally, I have been working on the polarization flipping dynamics of two-dimensional ferroelectric materials based on machine learning potential. In February 2021, I earned my Ph.D. degree from the  Department of Nanofusion Technology at Pusan National University, Korea, supervised by Professor Joonkyung Jang. My doctoral research was focused on soft condensed matter physics, including liquid dynamics, phase transition behavior, and interfacial properties using various computational methods and simulation techniques. Prior to my time  at Pusan National University, I completed my Bachelor of Science degree in July 2015 at the Department of Polymer Materials and Engineering, Zhongyuan University of Technology, China.

## Computational Design and Development of Li-Ion Concentrated Electrolytes

The wide electrochemical stability window and nonflammable characteristics exhibited by the localized super-high concentration aqueous electrolyte of lithium-ion batteries have brought new ideas for the development of next-generation power requirements. Ion transport, as one of the most fundamental processes of electrolytes, is important for the design and development of high performance nonflammable batteries. However, atomistic mechanisms and characteristics of ion transport in localized ultra-high concentration electrolytes remain largely unexplored. I employ the "modular development of deep potential" strategy, integrating deep learning, first-principles calculations, and molecular dynamics methods, to develop a deep neural network-based model potential known as Deep Potential(forcefield). The development of this deep potential is of great significance for enabling large-scale molecular dynamics simulations of complex high-concentration electrolytes, as well as opening up avenues for analyzing the microscopic structure, ion conductivity, and transport mechanisms of localized ultra-high concentration electrolytes.

 Two-dimensional (2D) ferroelectric semiconductors with electrically addressable vertical polarization present opportunities for integrating ferroelectrics into high-density ultrathin nanoelectronics, yet quantitative microscopic understanding of ferroelectric switching in 2D is rather limited. We employ deep-learning-assisted large-scale molecular dynamics simulations to analyze the switching processes of 2D domains and 1D domain walls in 2D ferroelectrics with out-of-plane polarization, revealing mechanisms fundamentally different from those of bulk ferroelectrics. We discover that a single domain is unswitchable by an out-of-plane electric field due to forbidden splitting of Wyckoff orbits. This ``splitting restriction principle" is a prevalent feature across a wide spectrum of 2D systems with sliding ferroelectricity and moir\'e ferroelectricity. Despite lacking in-plane effective polarization, 1D domain walls are easily moved by in-plane fields, exhibiting unusual avalanche dynamics characterized by abrupt, intermittent moving patterns. The propagating velocity at various temperatures, field orientations, and strengths can be statistically described with a universal creep equation, featuring a dynamical exponent of 2 that is distinct from all known values for elastic interfaces moving in disordered media. We demonstrate a tunable onset field for the intrinsic creep-depinning transition, suggesting a simple route for on-demand configuration of switching speed.
